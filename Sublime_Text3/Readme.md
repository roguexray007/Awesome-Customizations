this is just a simple `.notes` file and how good it looks. Imagine how your code will look.
theme is moderately dark and quite soothing actually

#### Observations
1. date shows in `red` color if file is modified and not saved yet, otherwise yellow color
2. tab shows in `red` color if file is modified and not saved yet, otherwise normal color
3. tab shows in `yellow` color when you hover mouse over it
4. overall color_scheme and theme is pretty appealing
