## Here is a list of lot of helpful terminal tools for daily development
- [Jump](https://github.com/gsamokovarov/jump) <br>
> Jump integrates with your shell and learns about your navigational habits by keeping track of the directories you visit. It gives you the most visited directory for the shortest search term you type.<br>

- [Peco](https://github.com/peco/peco)
> peco can be a great tool to filter stuff like logs, process stats, find files, because unlike grep, you can type as you think and look through the current results.
